================

Lattice reduction tools.
Currently only implements L3FP (L^3-Reduction in floating point) and L3FP with deep insertion.

See "Lattice Basis Reduction: Improved Practical Algorithms and Solving Subset Sum Problems" - C. P. Schnorr. M. Euchner.

Lattice reduction is a techinque for finding small basis for a lattice. Many problems in cryptograph can be posed as problems on a lattice with the solution being a small vector in the lattice. One example of such a problem is the 'knapsack problem.'
